# Mini-Bank System

This is a simple C++ program that simulates a mini-bank system where users can calculate the interest on their deposits. The program allows users to:

- Input bank details (principal amount and interest rate).
- Display the yearly amount for 10 years.
- Display the amount for a specified year.

## Features

- **Interest Calculation:** Computes compound interest for a specified number of years.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interactive console-based system.
- **Multiple Operations:** Users can perform multiple calculations in one session.

## How It Works

1. The user selects an option:
   - `1` to enter bank details.
   - `2` to display yearly amount for 10 years.
   - `3` to display the amount for a specific year.
2. The program calculates the interest using the compound interest formula:

   \[
   A = P (1 + r)^n
   \]

   Where:
   - `A` = Final amount
   - `P` = Principal (initial deposit)
   - `r` = Interest rate
   - `n` = Number of years

3. The program outputs the results accordingly.
