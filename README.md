# Mini-Bank-System
This C++ program simulates a simple banking system that calculates interest on a deposit over a period of time. The user can input initial deposit details and choose between viewing the yearly interest accumulation for 10 years or checking the amount for a specific year. The program continuously allows operations until the user decides to exit.
